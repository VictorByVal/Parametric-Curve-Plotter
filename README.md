 📌 Features

- Plot 2D parametric curves easily
- Customizable functions: x(t) and y(t)
- Adjustable parameter range (t_min, t_max) and step size
- Color and line style customization
- Interactive cells for quick experimentation

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and the following packages installed:

- matplotlib
- numpy
- jupyter
- Installation

🛠️ Customization

You can easily modify the functions or add input widgets to make the notebook interactive. Ideal for students, educators, and enthusiasts exploring parametric equations.
